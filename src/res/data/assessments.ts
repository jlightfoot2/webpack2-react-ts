Take a copy of your assessment results with you to share the details of your problem. A provider can help target the specific problems you might be having and will help develop a plan to improve your sense of connection to others. You can locate a provider or a clinic near you by clicking on the <a href='http://afterdeployment.dcoe.mil/locate-help'>LOCATE</a> tab in the upper right corner of the main page. We recommend you take a copy of the results of this assessment and share them during your appointment.</p><p>If you have more immediate concerns, you can talk with a professional right now by clicking on the <a href='http://afterdeployment.dcoe.mil/home?qt-quick_tab_header=2#qt-quick_tab_header'>CALL</a> or <a href='http://afterdeployment.dcoe.mil/home?qt-quick_tab_header=1#qt-quick_tab_header'>CHAT</a> tabs, also found in the upper right corner of the main page.  Both the CALL and CHAT options are available 24-7.</p>  <p>When someone has a problem with social support, problems are often present in other areas of life. You can determine where other problems may exist or the extent of the problem by taking additional assessments.</p>  <p>We also encourage you to check out the materials in AfterDeployment's "Families and Friendships" and "Work Adjustment" topics to find out more about how to deal with difficulties in relationships upon return from deployment. You will find information and strategies to help develop social supports.</p>  <p>Take a look at how comfortable you are with asking for support. You may find that you are giving people the message that you are OK and don't need or want support. It is a common mistake to believe that if you have to ask for support it means that people don’t care. Many people are more than happy to provide help and support if they understand the need. Remember that people can't read your mind.</p><p>You can find links to these tools under the RESOURCES tab located above.</p><p> You may find it helpful to join the <a href='https://www.facebook.com/afterdeployment/timeline'>AfterDeployment Facebook</a> page where you can network with others on a range of topics. </p>`
